# Testing With Python

This resource is to be used as a reference for building test suites with Python and RobotFramework. This is by no means meant to be a complete reference of ether Python or RobotFramework but as a 'Getting Started' from limited to no Python experience to running automated and manual test suites with the defined technologies.  

There is no attempt made to provide a tutorial on python use and programming outside of testing. That is to say; this document will explore testing procedures and practices, not the organic design of applications, modules, or classes. The interaction between Python and RobotFramework can be made very rigid and thus can be used as a jumping off point for deeper learning and understanding.
  
Where possible reference to the source documentation is made. It should be noted that the pep8 style guide is used for all Python code samples. RobotFramework does not, at the time of writing, have a standard style guide so code style choices in robot samples are of personal preference. A reference to those style choiced is available [here](./robot/style_gyide.md).
